Code snippets are small blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task in programming.
Code snippets are valuable because they save time and effort, making it easier to understand or implement a particular function or feature in a program.
They can be found in various programming environments where they might be pre-built for common tasks like loops, conditionals.

For an example, to create a for loop, you can simply type `for` then double tap the `TAB` key.

> I am using Visual Studio as my preferred IDE, the macro action may differ in other IDEs.
{: .prompt-info }

However, if you wish, you can also create your own custom code snippets.
Although I won't show you the entire process, you can easily learn it with a simple search.
Instead, I'll show you some of the code snippets I use. This way, you'll see how quickly and easily I can generate repetitive lines of code.
