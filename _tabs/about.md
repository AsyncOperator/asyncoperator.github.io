I am a hardworking, team-oriented programmer who strives to write
clean, sustainable, cache-friendly code. I'm always eager to learn
new technologies and methodologies to improve my skill set. Currently,
I reside in Ankara and primarily focused on mobile game development.

My interest in games flourished during my childhood while playing
various games with my elder brother. This passion led me to pursue
a career in game development, motivating me to further my knowledge
by studying software engineering at university.

I am proficient in quickly mastering new tools in the workplace,
facilitating close communication across various disciplines,
and adapting to the evolving needs of the team. While I specialize in
gameplay programming, I enjoy tackling any problem that I encounter.

In my free time, I love to try out different indie games and
play chess.
